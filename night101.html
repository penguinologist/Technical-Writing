<p>It's been a long day. Time for some well deserved rest. Here's how you go about it.</p>


<ol>
<li>Put on your pyjamas. Due to the difficulty in actually locating these, this shall be left up to you to figure out.</li>
<li>Proceed by plugging in your phone to a charger and setting your alarm. 15 minutes prior to your classes will suffice.</li>
<li>At this point, you're almost ready. Turn off any lights and close the door.</li>
<li>Head to the bed and make an epic fall on the bed and close your eyes. </li>
<li>Wait until you fall asleep. If this is taking too long, feel free to dream about impossible feats in which you are the main character.</li>
</ol>
<p>That is how I fall asleep.</p>
