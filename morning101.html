<p>The birds are chirping. The air is still a little humid and cold. The drill seargant is running the cadets outside your window. The alarm is still beeping for the fourth time. Sound familiar doesn't it? Have no fear! Follow these 8 steps to become the amazing human I am to conquer the quest of getting out of bed.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>That alarm clock bothers you. Cover your ears by using the pillow below your head.</p><p>CAUTION : Do not cover your mouth and/or nose. Doing so may cause great bodily harm and can result in death by asphyxiation.</p></li>
<li>Wait for about 30 seconds or until the sound penetrates the pillow and inhibits your ability to fall back to sleep.</li>
<li>Reach for the alarm and turn it off.</li>
<li>Roll around in bed again until comfortable, but try not to fall back to sleep.</li>
<li>Stare at the ceiling for a little while until lucid enough to sit up straight on the bed.</li>
<li>Almost done. Remove any covering blankets or sheets from you by tossing them aside.</li>
<li>Proceed to move both legs off the side of the bed.<li>
<li>Using all your willpower and physical force left in your body, make a sudden jerk forward and stand up.</li>
</ol>

<p>All done! Now you're ready to go for the rest of the day!</p>
