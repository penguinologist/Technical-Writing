<h1>Communication 101</h1>
<img src="./images/communication.png" />
<p>Nowadays, the human race lives in a world where everyone is talking, tweeting, IMing, snapchatting, texting, and much more. However, if you wish to be me, you will need to follow the following guidelines:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unless absolutely necessary, avoid contact at all costs.</li>
<li>If a situation arises where communication is essential, use short, yet sufficiently descriptive sentences. NO LONG SPEECHES!!!</li>
<li>Always look at the shoes of the other person first. If they are wearing dress shoes, muster all your courage and look them in the eyes and try not to blink too often. Else, just look at objects in the distance next to their faces.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using these guidelines, procede to communicate following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Determine if the other person is of importance.</li>
<li>If important, act according to the guidelines. Else politely decline to address them by ignoring any and all actions performed by the other person.</li>
<li>When the other person decides the conversation is finished, tell them "Goodbye! Have a nice day."</li>
</ol>
<p>These steps should suffice to respond to 90% of all communication in Jeroen Goossens's average day.</p>
